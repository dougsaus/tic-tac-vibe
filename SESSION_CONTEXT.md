# Session Context: Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This document provides a summary of the development session for the Phaser 3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. It can be used to quickly bring a developer (or a new AI assistant instance) up to speed on the project's history, features, and key decisions.

## 1. Initial Project Setup

-   **Goal:** Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Phaser 3.
-   **Bootstrap:**
    -   Initialized a Git repository.
    -   Created a `package.json` with `npm init -y`.
    -   Installed core dependencies: `phaser`, `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, `typescript`, `ts-loader`.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   `webpack.config.js` was set up to compile `src/game.ts` into a `dist/bundle.js`. The `devServer` was configured to serve from the project root.
    -   `tsconfig.json` was configured for TypeScript.
    -   `index.html` was created as the main entry point.

## 2. Core Gameplay Implementation

-   **Scenes:**
    -   The initial game logic was built within a single `GameScene` in `src/game.ts`.
    -   A `SetupScene` was later introduced in `src/SetupScene.ts` to handle pre-game configuration.
-   **Game Logic:**
    -   Implemented a 3x3 game board, turn-based player logic, and visual representation of 'X' and 'O's (later emojis).
    -   Added win/draw condition checking.
    -   Added a scoring system to track wins and draws across rounds.
    -   Implemented "New Round" and "New Game" functionality.

## 3. Feature: Customizable Player Setup

-   The initial `window.prompt` for names was replaced with a dedicated HTML form managed by `SetupScene`.
-   **Features Added:**
    -   Inputs for player names.
    -   Dropdowns (`<select>`) for players to choose emoji symbols.
    -   Logic to prevent players from selecting the same symbol.
    -   Color pickers (`<input type="color">`) for players to choose their winning line color.

## 4. Debugging & Troubleshooting

-   **Blank Page (404 Error):** Solved an issue where `bundle.js` was not found by adding `publicPath: '/dist/'` to the webpack output configuration.
-   **Sound Playback Failure:** This was a major multi-step issue.
    -   **Symptom:** Sounds were not playing despite network requests for the `.mp3` files returning 200 OK.
    -   **Diagnosis:** Determined that while the files were being downloaded, the browser/Phaser was failing to decode the MP3s silently.
    -   **Solution:**
        1.  Converted all sound effects from `.mp3` to `.ogg` format, which is more reliably decoded by web browsers.
        2.  Updated the Phaser asset loader to try loading the `.ogg` version first, with the `.mp3` as a fallback.
        3.  Changed the sound playback call from `this.sound.get(key).play()` to the more direct and robust `this.sound.play(key)`.
-   **Color Picker CSS Bug:** Fixed an issue where the color picker input in the setup form was not displaying the selected color due to a CSS `padding` conflict.

## 5. UI/UX Modernization

-   A `DESIGN_PLAN.md` was created to outline a full visual redesign.
-   **Setup Screen (`index.html`):**
    -   The setup form was completely restyled into a modern "card" with a clean layout, rounded corners, and a box shadow.
    -   A modern font ('Poppins') from Google Fonts was imported and applied.
    -   All form elements (`input`, `select`, `button`) were given a consistent, modern style with hover and focus states.
-   **Game Scene (Phaser):**
    -   The new font and color scheme were applied to all in-game text (title, status, scores).
    -   Game board cells were given a softer color and an interactive hover effect.
    -   In-game buttons ("New Round", "New Game") were restyled to match the setup screen's button.
    -   The winning line was updated to animate with a "draw" effect using a Phaser tween for a more polished feel.

## 6. Repository Management

-   A comprehensive `README.md` was created for new developers.
-   The project was successfully pushed to a new public GitHub repository named `tic-tac-vibe`.
