# Phaser 3 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a modern, web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Phaser 3, TypeScript, and Webpack. It features a dynamic setup screen, customizable player options, scoring, sound effects, and a clean, interactive gameplay experience.

The intended audience for this document is a developer new to the project who needs to understand the architecture, setup the development environment, and begin contributing.

## Features

-   **Interactive Game Board:** A classic 3x3 grid where players can place their symbols.
-   **Customizable Player Setup:**
    -   Players can enter their own names.
    -   Players can choose their game symbol from a list of emojis (e.g., 🐱, 🍕, 🚀).
    -   The system prevents both players from choosing the same symbol.
    -   Players can choose the color of the line that appears when they win.
-   **Turn-Based Gameplay:** The game manages player turns, clearly indicating whose turn it is.
-   **Win/Draw Detection:** The game automatically detects and announces if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
-   **Winning Line:** A colored line is drawn through the three winning symbols.
-   **Scoring System:** Persistent scores for each player's wins and the number of draws are tracked across rounds.
-   **Sound Effects:**
    -   Unique sound effects for different emoji symbols.
    -   Specific sounds for winning a round or a draw.
-   **New Round / New Game:**
    -   Players can start a "New Round" which resets the board but keeps the scores and players. The loser of the previous round starts the next one.
    -   Players can start a "New Game" which takes them back to the setup screen to re-configure players and resets the scores.

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run the following command in the project root to install all necessary packages from `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

This project uses `webpack-dev-server` for a live-reloading development experience.

-   **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
-   This will automatically open the game in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
-   The server watches for changes in the source files (`.ts`, `.html`) and will automatically re-bundle and reload the page.

### Building for Production

To create a static bundle in the `/dist` directory, you can run the build script.
```bash
npm run build
```

## Running with Docker

You can run the application inside a Docker container using Cloud Native Buildpacks or the traditional Dockerfile approach.

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
*   [Pack CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/) for buildpack builds (install with `brew install buildpacks/tap/pack` on macOS).

### Using Cloud Native Buildpacks (Recommended)

We provide a Makefile for easy container management with buildpacks:

```bash
# Build and run the container (default)
make

# Or explicitly:
make all

# Individual commands:
make build    # Build the container using buildpacks
make run      # Run the container on port 8080
make stop     # Stop and remove the container
make clean    # Clean up container and images
make dev      # Run development server locally
make test     # Run tests in headless mode
```

The buildpack approach automatically:
- Detects and installs Node.js dependencies
- Runs the webpack build
- Configures NGINX to serve the static files
- Creates a production-ready container

### Using Traditional Dockerfile

The original Dockerfile is still available for comparison:

```bash
./build-and-run.sh
```

This script will automatically handle stopping and removing any old containers with the same name. Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Troubleshooting

### Buildpack Issues

**Problem: Build fails with "unable to create manifests file" error**
- **Solution**: Disable containerd storage in Docker Desktop settings and restart Docker

**Problem: Platform warning about linux/amd64 vs linux/arm64**
- **Solution**: This is a warning only; the container will still run on Apple Silicon Macs using emulation
- **Future**: Multi-architecture support can be added to the buildpack configuration

**Problem: Container exits immediately after starting**
- **Solution**: Check logs with `docker logs tic-tac-vibe` - common issues include:
  - Missing nginx.conf file
  - Port conflicts on 8080
  - File permission issues

**Problem: Assets not loading (404 errors)**
- **Solution**: Ensure the nginx.conf file has correct paths for `/dist/` and `/assets/` directories

### Development Issues

**Problem: Changes not reflected after rebuilding**
- **Solution**: Run `make clean` before `make build` to ensure a fresh build
- **Alternative**: Use `make dev` for live-reloading during development

**Problem: Tests failing with "Cannot connect to localhost:8080"**
- **Solution**: Ensure no other services are using port 8080
- **Check**: Run `lsof -i :8080` to see what's using the port

### Performance Issues

**Problem: Build takes too long**
- **Solution**: Buildpack builds cache layers; subsequent builds should be faster
- **Tip**: Use `make dev` for development instead of rebuilding containers
