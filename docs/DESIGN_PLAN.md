# Modern UI/UX Design Plan for Tic-Tac-Toe

This document outlines a plan to modernize the visual design of the Phaser Tic-Tac-Toe game, focusing on a cleaner, more engaging user experience.

## 1. Global Styles & Theme

- [x] **Color Palette:**
    - [x] **Primary Background:** A soft off-white (`#F8F9FA`) or a light gray (`#E9ECEF`).
    - [x] **Primary Text:** A dark charcoal color (`#212529`).
    - [x] **Accent/Primary Action Color:** A vibrant blue (`#007BFF`).
    - [x] **Secondary Action Color:** A friendly green (`#28a745`).
    - [x] **Winning/Alert Color:** A clear red/pink (`#DC3545`).
- [x] **Typography:**
    - [x] Use a modern, sans-serif font from Google Fonts (e.g., 'Poppins').
    - [x] Apply this font to all HTML elements.
- [x] **Layout:**
    - [x] Center the entire experience on the page.

## 2. Game Setup Screen (`index.html`)

- [x] **Layout:**
    - [x] Style `div#setupForm` as a "card" with a light background, rounded corners, and a box shadow.
    - [x] Use Flexbox to center the card's content.
- [x] **Header:**
    - [x] Add an `<h1>` title like "Game Setup".
- [x] **Player Configuration Sections:**
    - [x] Group each player's controls into their own `div`.
    - [x] Use Flexbox for side-by-side layout on larger screens and stacked on smaller screens (media queries).
- [x] **Form Elements:**
    - [x] **Text Inputs:** Apply modern, custom styles.
    - [x] **Symbol Selects:**
        - [x] Apply modern, custom styles to `<select>` elements.
        - [x] Style the `option[disabled]` state to be visually clear.
    - [x] **Color Pickers:** Apply modern, custom styles.
- [x] **Start Game Button:**
    - [x] Make the button larger and more prominent.
    - [x] Add hover and active states for better interactivity.

## 3. Game Board Scene (Phaser)

- [x] **Board & Cells:**
    - [x] Soften the cell stroke color.
    - [x] Add a hover effect to cells.
- [x] **Buttons:**
    - [x] Style "New Round" and "New Game" buttons to match the CSS buttons.
- [x] **Text:**
    - [x] Ensure all Phaser text objects use the chosen modern font.
    - [x] Make the status text larger and more prominent.
- [x] **Winning Line:**
    - [x] Animate the winning line using a Phaser tween.

This plan aims to create a cohesive and modern look and feel, improving the user's overall experience from setup to gameplay.

## 4. Future Enhancements

### 4.1 Technology Migration
- [ ] **React Migration:**
    - [ ] Convert the application from HTML forms to a full React application
    - [ ] Keep Phaser for the game board rendering and interaction
    - [ ] Migrate setup screen and UI controls to React components
    - [ ] Implement React hooks for state management (player data, game state, scores)
    - [ ] Add React Router for navigation between setup and game screens
    - [ ] Create React-Phaser integration layer for communication between React state and Phaser game
    - [ ] Maintain existing functionality while gaining React's component reusability and state management benefits

### 4.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **GitHub Actions Setup:**
    - [ ] **Code Quality:**
        - [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting
        - [ ] Add TypeScript type checking in CI
        - [ ] Run Cypress tests on every pull request
    - [ ] **Security & Dependencies:**
        - [ ] Implement security vulnerability scanning (e.g., npm audit, Snyk)
        - [ ] Set up automated dependency update checks (Dependabot)
        - [ ] Add license compliance checking
    - [ ] **Build & Deployment:**
        - [ ] Automated buildpack container builds on push to main
        - [ ] Deploy to staging environment for testing

        - [ ] Deploy to production environment with manual approval (see Section 4.4)
    - [ ] **Notifications:**
        - [ ] Set up build status badges in README
        - [ ] Configure failure notifications

### 4.3 AI Player Feature
- [ ] **Single Player Mode:**
    - [ ] Add option in setup screen for "Player vs AI" mode
    - [ ] **AI Model Selection:**
        - [ ] Dropdown to choose AI provider (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
        - [ ] API integration for each supported AI model
        - [ ] Secure API key management (environment variables, user input)
        - [ ] Fallback options if primary AI service is unavailable
    - [ ] **AI Difficulty Configuration:**
        - [ ] **Easy:** AI instructed to make random or suboptimal moves
        - [ ] **Medium:** AI instructed to play reasonably but not perfectly
        - [ ] **Hard:** AI instructed to play optimally using game theory
    - [ ] **AI Integration:**
        - [ ] Send current board state to AI model via API
        - [ ] Parse AI response for move selection
        - [ ] Handle AI response errors gracefully
        - [ ] Implement rate limiting and request timeouts

        - [ ] Configurable AI move delay for better UX
        - [ ] AI player customization (name, symbol, model, difficulty)
        - [ ] Display which AI model is being used during gameplay
    - [ ] **Testing:**
        - [ ] Mock AI responses for automated testing
        - [ ] E2E tests for single player gameplay
        - [ ] Error handling tests (network failures, API limits)
        - [ ] Performance testing for AI response times

### 4.4 Cloud Deployment
- [ ] **Manual/Scripted Deployment:**
