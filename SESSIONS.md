# Session 1: July 26, 2024 - Project Initialization & Implementation

This document provides a summary of the development session for the Phaser 3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. It can be used to quickly bring a developer (or a new AI assistant instance) up to speed on the project's history, features, and key decisions.

## 1.1 Initial Project Setup

-   **Goal:** Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Phaser 3.
-   **Bootstrap:**
    -   Initialized a Git repository.
    -   Created a `package.json` with `npm init -y`.
    -   Installed core dependencies: `phaser`, `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, `typescript`, `ts-loader`.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   `webpack.config.js` was set up to compile `src/game.ts` into a `dist/bundle.js`. The `devServer` was configured to serve from the project root.
    -   `tsconfig.json` was configured for TypeScript.
    -   `index.html` was created as the main entry point.

## 1.2 Core Gameplay Implementation

-   **Scenes:**
    -   The initial game logic was built within a single `GameScene` in `src/game.ts`.
    -   A `SetupScene` was later introduced in `src/SetupScene.ts` to handle pre-game configuration.
-   **Game Logic:**
    -   Implemented a 3x3 game board, turn-based player logic, and visual representation of 'X' and 'O's (later emojis).
    -   Added win/draw condition checking.
    -   Added a scoring system to track wins and draws across rounds.
    -   Implemented "New Round" and "New Game" functionality.

## 1.3 Feature: Customizable Player Setup

-   The initial `window.prompt` for names was replaced with a dedicated HTML form managed by `SetupScene`.
-   **Features Added:**
    -   Inputs for player names.
    -   Dropdowns (`<select>`) for players to choose emoji symbols.
    -   Logic to prevent players from selecting the same symbol.
    -   Color pickers (`<input type="color">`) for players to choose their winning line color.

## 1.4 Debugging & Troubleshooting

-   **Blank Page (404 Error):** Solved an issue where `bundle.js` was not found by adding `publicPath: '/dist/'` to the webpack output configuration.
-   **Sound Playback Failure:** This was a major multi-step issue.
    -   **Symptom:** Sounds were not playing despite network requests for the `.mp3` files returning 200 OK.
    -   **Diagnosis:** Determined that while the files were being downloaded, the browser/Phaser was failing to decode the MP3s silently.
    -   **Solution:**
        1.  Converted all sound effects from `.mp3` to `.ogg` format.
        2.  Updated the Phaser asset loader to try loading the `.ogg` version first.
        3.  Changed the sound playback call to the more direct `this.sound.play(key)`.
-   **Color Picker CSS Bug:** Fixed an issue where the color picker input was not displaying the selected color due to a CSS conflict.

## 1.5 UI/UX Modernization

-   A `DESIGN_PLAN.md` was created to outline a full visual redesign.
-   **Setup Screen (`index.html`):**
    -   Completely restyled into a modern "card" with a clean layout, rounded corners, and a box shadow.
    -   A modern font ('Poppins') was imported and applied.
    -   All form elements were given a consistent, modern style.
-   **Game Scene (Phaser):**
    -   The new font and color scheme were applied to all in-game text.
    -   Game board cells were given a softer color and an interactive hover effect.
    -   In-game buttons were restyled to match the setup screen's button.
    -   The winning line was updated to animate with a "draw" effect.

## 1.6 Repository Management

-   A comprehensive `README.md` was created for new developers.
-   The project was successfully pushed to a new public GitHub repository named `tic-tac-vibe`. 
-   This session context file (`SESSIONS.md`) was created. 

# Session 2: July 27, 2024 - E2E Testing with Cypress

## 2.1 Test Suite Setup & Initial Tests

-   **Goal:** Implement a robust End-to-End (E2E) testing suite using Cypress to validate game functionality.
-   **Plan:** A `TESTING_PLAN.md` was created to outline the full testing strategy, scenarios, and status.
-   **Setup:**
    -   Installed `cypress` and `start-server-and-test` as dev dependencies.
    -   Added `test` and `test:headless` scripts to `package.json` to run Cypress.
    -   Added `data-testid` attributes to all interactive elements in `index.html` to create durable test selectors.
-   **Initial Tests:**
    -   Wrote tests for the setup screen, including default values, player configuration updates, and symbol uniqueness enforcement.

## 2.2 Major Debugging: Testing Canvas Events

-   **Challenge:** A significant portion of the session was dedicated to solving a complex issue where Cypress tests could not reliably detect custom DOM events (`moveMade`, `gameWin`, `gameDraw`) dispatched from the Phaser `GameScene`.
-   **Initial Approach & Failure:**
    -   The initial tests used `cy.spy(win, 'dispatchEvent')` to spy on the window's dispatch method.
    -   **Problem:** This failed because the Phaser game canvas runs in a separate context, and its `window` is not the same as the main application `window` that Cypress instruments.
-   **Iterative Solutions & Failures:**
    1.  **Spying on `document`:** The code was refactored to dispatch and listen for events on the `document` object. This also failed, indicating the context issue was more profound.
    2.  **Using a Global Variable:** A new strategy was implemented where the game would set a global variable (`window.lastEvent`) upon dispatching an event. The tests would then check this variable.
    -   **Problem:** This introduced multiple TypeScript and linter errors in the Cypress test file related to extending the `Cypress.AUTWindow` type. After several failed automated attempts to fix the type definitions, this approach was abandoned to prevent further complications.
-   **Resolution:**
    -   **Action:** Reverted all changes back to the last known good commit where only the initial, non-event-driven tests were passing.
    -   **Outcome:** The test suite was returned to a stable, 100% passing state. The `TESTING_PLAN.md` was updated to accurately reflect this reverted status. This provides a clean slate for the next session to correctly tackle the event-based testing challenge. 

# Session 3: July 28, 2024 - Robust Canvas Interaction Testing

## 3.1 Goal: Test Core Gameplay Logic

-   **Objective:** Successfully implement a test for the first move in the game, a task that had previously failed due to the complexity of testing a canvas-based application.

## 3.2 Iterative Debugging of Canvas Testing

-   **Challenge:** The primary obstacle was the inability for Cypress to reliably trigger or verify events within the Phaser `<canvas>` element. Standard E2E testing methods proved ineffective.
-   **Failed Approaches:**
    1.  **Event Spying (`moveMade`):** An initial attempt to spy on a custom event failed as it was not detected by Cypress.
    2.  **Reading Canvas Text (`cy.contains`):** This failed because text rendered by Phaser inside the canvas is not part of the DOM and is therefore invisible to Cypress's DOM-based commands.
    3.  **Simulated Clicks (`cy.click(x, y)`):** Multiple attempts to simulate clicks with both general and precisely calculated coordinates failed to trigger the game's state update, indicating a disconnect between Cypress's synthetic events and Phaser's input system.

## 3.3 Breakthrough: Direct State Manipulation and Verification

-   **Diagnosis:** The root cause was identified as a two-fold race condition:
    1.  Cypress tests were executing before the Phaser scene was fully initialized and ready for input.
    2.  Cypress commands were not reliably mapped to Phaser's internal input handling.
-   **Solution:** A robust testing "API" was created to allow Cypress to directly and reliably interact with the game scene, bypassing the flaky canvas interface.
    -   **Exposed Game Instance:** The main Phaser game instance was attached to the `window` (`window.phaserGame`) to make it accessible to Cypress.
    -   **Public Game API:**
        -   The `handleCellClick` method in `GameScene` was made `public` so it could be called directly from the test.
        -   Public getter methods (`getBoardState`, `getActivePlayerInfo`) were added to allow the test to read the game's internal state cleanly.
    -   **Readiness Signal:** An `isReady` flag was added to `GameScene`, set to `true` only at the end of its `create()` method. The Cypress test was modified to wait for this signal (`cy.wrap(gameScene).should('satisfy', scene => scene.isSceneReady())`) before proceeding.
-   **Outcome:** The test for making a move now passes consistently. This establishes a stable and reliable pattern for all subsequent gameplay-related tests. The `TESTING_PLAN.md` was updated, and the successful changes were committed and pushed. 

# Session 4: June 30, 2025 - Containerization and Build Automation

## 4.1 Initial Dockerization

-   **Goal:** Containerize the application using a `Dockerfile`.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Created a `Dockerfile` for a multi-stage build (Node.js for building, Nginx for serving static assets).
    -   Created a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build context.
    -   Updated `README.md` with instructions for building and running the Docker container.
    -   Updated `.gitignore` to exclude IntelliJ IDEA files.
-   **Debugging:**
    -   Resolved an issue where Nginx displayed a "Welcome" page instead of the application by ensuring `index.html` and the `assets` directory were correctly copied to the Nginx web root within the `Dockerfile`.

## 4.2 Automated Build and Run Script

-   **Goal:** Automate the process of building the application, Docker image, and running the container.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Created a `build-and-run.sh` script to orchestrate `npm run build`, `docker build`, and `docker run`.
    -   Implemented robust container cleanup logic within the script (stopping and forcefully removing existing containers) and a wait mechanism to prevent "port already allocated" errors.

## 4.3 Attempted Transition to Cloud Native Buildpacks

-   **Goal:** Convert the containerization process to use Cloud Native Buildpacks for a simplified build.
-   **Implementation & Debugging:**
    -   Removed `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and `build-and-run.sh`.
    -   Installed `pack` CLI via Homebrew.
    -   Modified `webpack.config.js` to use `html-webpack-plugin` and `copy-webpack-plugin` to ensure `index.html` and `assets` were correctly placed in the `dist` directory for Buildpack detection.
    -   Created a `Procfile` (`web: nginx`, then `web: staticfile`) to guide the Buildpacks.
    -   Attempted `pack build` with various configurations (`--path dist`, `--env BP_WEB_ROOT=dist`, `--env BP_WEB_SERVER=nginx`, explicit buildpack selection, and `--exclude-buildpack` flags).
    -   Encountered persistent and unresolvable Docker daemon errors (`unable to create manifests file: NotFound: content digest sha256:...: not found`) that prevented successful Buildpack image creation.
-   **Decision:** Due to the unresolvable underlying Docker daemon issues, the Cloud Native Buildpacks approach was abandoned for this session. The project was reverted to its last working state using the `Dockerfile` approach.



## 4.5 Git Management

-   **Action:** Staged and committed all changes related to Dockerization and build automation.
-   **Action:** Pushed the committed changes to the GitHub repository.
