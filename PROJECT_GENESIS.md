# Why does this project exist?

My wife works for a company that creates web based software and one of the elements of that software is simple javascript based games used for therapy (I'm being intentionally vague as to not divulge any proprietary information).  It is important to note that she is a speech language pathologist by trade and not a software engineer.  She wanted to understand what AI was capable of when it game to the development of these games using project constraints they use today.  

I am a seasonedsoftware engineer who has been writing my own code for my whole career and in the last couple of years have dabbled with generative AI mostly through a simple prompt and answer basis to helpo solve problems, tourbleshoot issues, and learn new technologies quickly.  However, I wanted to get familiar with vibe coding and its cpabailities.  So this project was born and it likely will not be the last as I take this journey with my wife. 

So we sought to answer some things:
* What is generative AI capable of today?
* What AI models work best for vibe coding?
* What is the cost of vibe coding?
* Can AIs create functional phaser.io based games?
* Can I create an application in languages and frameworks with which I am unfamiliar without writing any code myself?

The answers to these questions and probably many others can help use provide recommendations on generative AI usage in our respective jobs.

So, the way I approached this project was as follows:
* Treat the project like a consulting engagement.  This may become even more true in future projects where we pick game rules that are not already well known.
* Don't write any code manually
* Try out different AI models (ChaptGPT, claude, gemeini) and different AI-first development environments (github copilot, claude code, cursor).
* Start out free and expand into paid services as needed


## Progress So Far
* Everything in this project so far has been done in Cursor using mostly gemini-2.5-pro model as that got me the furthest without paying for anything yet.  
* We have created a working tic tac toe game written in typescript and using phaser.  
* We created design and testing plans in markdown and executed those to completion.
* I have run into the limit of my free pro trial with Cursor and must pay to continue.
